SOURCE CODE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the ./SRC folder you will find example of code written in c. This code can be used as starting point for your project. Please notice that is relative large and many functions are not tested or optimized! You can use it for picking up the few libraries, functions or code lines that you need!
We used COIDE from COOCOX as developing IDE, a free opensource IDE for Cortex-M3 core wich run on windows. if you are a linux user you will need a toolchain and create some makefiles.

For your convenience, we included the complete project, including ST-libraries. Notice that recently ST has released a new version of the libraries wich are not back-compatible. 

Instructions:
	Just clone the repo and open the project in CoIde!
	Modify the main with the function call that you need...
